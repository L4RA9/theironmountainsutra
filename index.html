        The Buddha traversed variable raiment
        Each moment a stair
        for the simple clothing
        of tundra stasis SamƒÅdhi
        Born from the cyclone
        from the ellipsis
        from the native body
        of sweet mulberries
        At the peak, snow and Samsara appear
        in a particle of tranquilizing fire
        following the Buddha's death
        around The Iron Mountain</pre>
<p style="color:azure;"> There was nothing left except the sound of an Automated Teller.<br>
  I walked on screaming through the Automated Teller until my arrival<br>
  at a door. On this door was a sign. The sign read <br> 
  [YOU ARE ALONE HERE]. It took my whole life, like a life taken by death, to realize<br>
  that the letters of the sign pointed inward to where I was. And the sign became true
  of my soul being alone.<br>
  Then I tried to tell the sign of a people about the Automated Teller<br>
  called the mind but they could not see me and I did not exist<br></p>
  <p style="color:azure;"> When hungry remain undistracted<br>
    focused on preparing what is good<br>
    <pre style="color:azure;"><i>
   I write from the utter unknowing void 
   not knowing if I am alive or dead</i></pre>
  <pre>
  Set aside portion
  and with one or two spices from a window
  hear the Lotus Born Sutra</pre>
<p><i>Tantra</i><br>
  Whenever there is possibility<br>
  the dichotomy becomes inscrutable</p>
