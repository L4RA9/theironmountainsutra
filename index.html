<p>Along the variable raiment are altitudes<br>
  The wind searching for the Monarch Monal<br>
under a Mountain bird's feet<br>
born from the native body<br>
of sweet mulberries<br>
At the peak<br>
there is that particle of tranquilizing fire<br>
still following the Buddha's death<br>
around The Iron Mountain
