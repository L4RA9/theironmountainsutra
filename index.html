    <p style="color:#8BC34A;">The Buddha traversed variable raiment<br>
        Each moment a stair<br>
        for the simple clothing<br>
        of tundra stasis SamƒÅdhi<br>
        Born from the cyclone<br>
        from the ellipsis<br>
        from the native body<br>
        of sweet mulberries<br>
        At the peak, snow and Samsara appear<br>
        in a particle of tranquilizing fire<br>
        following the Buddha's death<br>
        around The Iron Mountain<br>
      </p>
<p style="color:azure;"> There was nothing left except the sound of an Automated Teller.<br>
  I walked on screaming through the Automated Teller until my arrival<br>
  at a door. On this door was a sign. The sign read <br> 
  [YOU ARE ALONE HERE]. It took my whole life, like a life taken by death, to realize<br>
  that the letters of the sign pointed inward to where I was. And the sign became true
  of my soul being alone.<br>
  Then I tried to tell the sign of a people about the Automated Teller<br>
  called the mind but they could not see me and I did not exist<br></p>
  <p style="color:azure;"> When hungry remain undistracted<br>
    focused on preparing what is good<br>
  <br><i>
  I write in the dark from the utter unknowing void not knowing if I am alive or dead</i><br>
  <br>
  Set aside portion<br>
  and with one or two spices <span class="styled"><b>from a window</b></span><br>
  hear the Lotus Born Sutra<br></p> 
  <p style="color:azure;">Fall to the floor The Fullest<br>
    Sparrow on the wind<br>
    madly disoriented with transcendence<br>
