<p>The Buddha walked on altitudes<br>
  along variable raiment. Each moment a stair<br>
  is placed for the simple clothing<br>
  made of atmosphere<br>
  floating up from the no-mind<br>
  Born from the cyclone<br>
  from the ellipsis<br>
  from the native body<br>
  of sweet mulberries<br>
  At the peak, snow and Samsara appear<br>
  in a particle of tranquilizing fire<br>
following the Buddha's death<br>
around The Iron Mountain
