    <p>The Buddha traversed variable raiment<br>
        Each moment a stair<br>
        for the simple clothing<br>
        of tundra stasis SamƒÅdhi<br>
        Born from the cyclone<br>
        from the ellipsis<br>
        from the native body<br>
        of sweet mulberries<br>
        At the peak, snow and Samsara appear<br>
        in a particle of tranquilizing fire<br>
        following the Buddha's death<br>
        around The Iron Mountain<br>
      </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>There was nothing left except the sound of an Automated Teller. The word of my person was erased by the void <br>
  that was everywhere. I walked through the sound of the Automated Teller for years until my arrival<br>
  at a door. On this door was a sign. The sign read:YOU ARE ALONE HERE. And I understood the sign to be true
  of my being alone.<br></p>
