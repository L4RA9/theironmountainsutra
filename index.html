        The Buddha traversed variable raiment
        Each moment a stair
        for the simple clothing
        of tundra stasis SamƒÅdhi
        Born from the cyclone
        from the ellipsis
        from the native body
        of sweet mulberries
        At the peak, snow and Samsara appear
        in a particle of tranquilizing fire
        following the Buddha's death
        around The Iron Mountain</pre>
<p style="color:azure;"> At the age of twenty-eight the voice within me died<br>
  and there was nothing except the Automated Teller.<br>
  I walked on dominated by the Automated Teller until my arrival.<br>
  On the door was a sign. The sign read <br> 
  [YOU ARE ALONE]. <br>
  It took my whole life, like a life taken by death, to realize<br>
  that the letters of the sign pointed inward to where I was. And the sign became true
  of my soul being.<br>
  I tried to tell the sign of a people about the Automated Teller<br>
  called the mind but they could not see me and I did not exist<br></p>
  <p style="color:azure;"> When hungry remain undistracted<br>
    focused on preparing what is good<br>
    <pre style="color:azure;"><i>
   I write from the utter unknowing void</i></pre>
  <pre>
  Set aside portion
  and with one or two spices from a window
  hear the Lotus Born Sutra</pre>
       <pre style="color:azure;"><i>Tantra</i><br>

  Whenever there is possibility
  the dichotomy becomes inscrutable</pre>

  <pre style="color:azure;">
    [picks up the phone]
    I'm in the backseat driving on the verge of tears 
    I was at the grocery store minding my own business when
    Once upon a time the dogs were outside barking
    Be calm my soul refrain from speaking 
    The bills are on the table 
    Shots are being fired in the forest 
    [Instructions] is she Transforming? 
    I'm an alienist define define define 
    I'm an alienist analyze analyze analyze
    Do you mean? I mean...
    At the center, the core Buddha 
    raises the right sleeve in a gesture of Bushido 
    This introduces a new category before appearance 
    of perceive approach 
    Appearance may try to counter 
    The core Buddha will then raise a stalk with the right sleeve 
    Into what appearance cannot defy 
    Turning stalk through the sleeve
    </pre>
    <pre style="color:azure;"><i>Tantra</i><br>
    I'm the Remainder in you
    you are the remains of what I perceive
